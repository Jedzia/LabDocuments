# Collection of Lab Documents #

Some Cheat-Sheets and Layouts I use in my lab. They come in handy when putting together prototypes 
and you need to have a quick look at how things work.

- ARM
    - Blue Pill(Todo) and
    - Black Pill STM32F1 Development Boards
- USBtoSerial
    - FT232RL USB to Serial Adapter
    - CP2102 USB to Serial Adapter


## Design Goals ##

Some hints for me I should not forget when creating bench documents:

- What belongs together should stay together.

    A pinout and a schematic of the same device should be arranged on both sides of a
    spread that you can easily view them both when the page is open in a printed book format.
    Hint: Page 1 is the front/title page. Inside pairs go: 2+3, 4+5, 6+7 ...   

- Better go big than small.

    Readability on the lab-bench is more important than saving paper-space till unreadability. 
    In the field, dirt and working conditions won't make it easy: 
    > To make an omelet, you have to break eggs!

- Double check sources

    Some fucking idiots gave the STM32F103 'Black Pill' Pinout Drawing 14 analog pins. 

    > Don't trust the interweb! 

    Better take a look at the manufacturers datasheet.

## Code of Conduct ##

1. Don't swear in the documents.
2. Masters and Slaves are no fucking people. They are a hierarchical entity of electronic devices.
3. Women can sit there and fill in hundreds of pin definitions in one go without going mad. That is a
   psychological fact, but do not point that out anywhere!
4. Think of the visually impaired. Patterns with colors are preferable to colors alone. When the 
   content of a source material is to small to read, it has to be remade.
